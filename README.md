This synth is a pulse width modulated oscillator, routed through a light-controlled resonant low pass filter. The "growling" oscillator tonality is supplied via a PWM and an awesome high-resonance low pass filter. The oscillator is controlled via 2 Light dependent resistors (LDR) and gives you the ability to create amazing musical expression. The 13 “keys” give you different tones and allow you to play it like a 1 octave keyboard.


Also included is 2 Hex inverter drones, supplied via a 40106 IC. The 2 two adjustable drone oscillators give this synth three oscillators in total. You also have the ability to turn off the 2 hex inverter drones and just play around with the other oscillator.
Also included is a delay section via a echo/reverb module that has been modified to include feedback.


Lastly, I've included in this build an arpeggiator (like in the first version I built) which really makes this synth so much fun to play! You also have the ability to play the synth just with one potentiometer and the LDR’s. When all this is combined with the echo/reverb feature you can really get some fantastic sounds from the synth.
